# EnvSeq

![EnvSeq screenshot](images/EnvSeq.png)

**EnvSeq** is a clocked envelope sequencer. Each step outputs a configurable shape (ramp/exp/log/flat/VOSC), with per-step level (Amp), offset, probability (chance to play), duration in clocks, optional retriggers (repeating the shape within the step) with fade, and per-step length (time-warp of the shape inside the step).

### I/O

|        | 1/3 | 2/4 |
| ------ | :-: | :-: |
| TRIG   | Clock (timebase) | Reset (or step trigger when `TR2` is enabled) |
| CV INs | Mod 1 (per `Mod1` mode) | Mod 2 (per `Mod2` mode) |
| OUTs   | Envelope CV | Assignable (`Out2` mode) |

### UI Controls
EnvSeq has two screens:

- **Main screen**: Mod1 mode, Mod2 mode, Out2 mode, Randomizer, TR2 mode, number of steps, Reset, Init.
- **Step screen**: Step number, shape (VOSC waveform index included), and per-step parameters (offset, amp, VOSC options, probability, triggers, clocks, length, retrigger fade, Mod2 mark, Copy/Paste).

## Mod1 (CV1) modes
`Mod1` defines how CV1 is sampled/applied:

| Mode   | Description                                                               |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mod    | CV1 is applied continuously to every step’s CV output.                   |
| H step | Sample & hold CV1 at each step start. The held value is used for the whole step. |
| H seq  | Sample & hold CV1 at the start of the sequence. The held value is used until the next sequence restart. |

## Mod2 (CV2) modes

| Mode     | Description                                                                                 |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Length   | CV2 modulates the **Length** parameter (time-warp of the shape within the step, bipolar, 1-200%)           |
| StepSel  | CV2 selects the **next played step** (unipolar **0–5V** mapped across the active `num_steps`). The selection is **sampled on the clock** when advancing steps. Step **Probability is ignored** in this mode, but multi-clock steps (`Clk`) are still honored (the current step holds until its clocks are done). |
| RetrgLvl | CV2 modulates the **Retrigger Level** (-15..15). Negative values fade in (0%→100%), positive values fade out (100%→0%), 0 = no fade. |
| Mod      | CV2 is added to the output CV for all steps.                                               |
| ModMark  | CV2 is added to the output CV only on steps marked with `Mod2` in the step editor.         |
| GateLen  | CV2 scales **Gate Length** (1–200% of the per-step gate length) for gate-based outputs. |

## Out2 modes
Output 2 can mirror or complement the main envelope output:

| Out2 Mode | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Cpy       | Copy of Out1 (same envelope CV) |
| Inv       | Mirrored copy of Out1 within the step’s amplitude range (vertical flip). |
| InvO      | Mirrored copy of Out1 around the step’s waveform offset (0–100% of amp). |
| HStart    | Holds the step’s start CV value until the next step begins |
| Step      | Short gate at each new (played) step |
| StepTrg   | Short gate at each new (played) step and retriggers within a step |
| Seq       | Short gate at the start of the sequence (on wraparound) |

Notes:
- Gates are only generated for steps whose Shape is neither `Hold` nor `Zero`.
- Gate pulse length is set per step via **Gate Length** and can be modulated by `GateLen`.

## Step screen
After the main page items, the cursor enters per-step editing. The **viewed step** (the one you edit) is independent from the **currently playing step** shown on the main page.

### Step number
Select which step number you’re editing.

### Shape
Shape for the step:
- `Hold`: silent step (holds the previous step’s output CV and generates no gates)
- `Zero`: outputs 0V but still counts as an active step (no gates generated)
- `Flat`: constant level (Amp)
- `ExpDw`: exponential-like Amp → 0
- `ExpUp`: exponential-like 0 → Amp
- `RampDw`: Amp → 0
- `RampUp`: 0 → Amp
- `LogDw`: logarithmic-like Amp → 0
- `LogUp`: logarithmic-like 0 → Amp
- `VOSC`: vector-oscillator waveform driven by step progress (shows a waveform number)

### Parameters

#### Offset
DC offset added to the step output (and used as the center point for `InvO`).

#### Amplitude (amp)
Bipolar amplitude of the step’s shape; negative values invert the shape.

#### Waveform offset (WaveOff)
Shifts the waveform relative to the step offset (0–100% of the step amp). Applies only when the Shape is set to `VOSC`.

#### Revert
Runs the waveform phase backwards. Applies only when the Shape is set to `VOSC`.

#### Invert
Flips the waveform vertically. Applies only when the Shape is set to `VOSC`.

#### Option
Post-process the waveform. Applies only when the Shape is set to `VOSC`.

- `None`: no post-processing.
- `FoldUp`: reflect upward the values below waveform offset.
- `FoldDw`: reflect downward the values above waveform offset.
- `ZeroUp`: zero out values above waveform offset.
- `ZeroDw`: zero out values below waveform offset.

#### Triggers
Sets how many times (1-8) the shape triggers within the step.

#### Clocks
How many incoming clocks (1-8) this step lasts.

#### Length
Time-warp of the shape progression within the step (1–200%).
- <100%: shape reaches the end early and then holds its final value for the remainder of the step.
- >100%: shape progresses more slowly (may not reach the end before the step completes).
- If `Mod2` mode is `Length`, CV2 scales this per-step value.

#### Probability (Prob)
Chance (0–100%) that this step will be played when the sequence reaches it.

#### Retrigger Level (RetrgLvl)
Sets the retrigger fade behavior in the range -15..15:
- `from 1` .. `from 15`: substract from first trigger and fade in from it to 100%
- `no`: no fade (all retriggers at 100%)
- `to 1` .. `to 15`: substract from last trigger and fade out from 100% to it

#### Mod Mark
Marks this step as eligible for Mod2 when `Mod2` mode is `ModMark`.

#### Gate Length (GateLen)
Sets the gate pulse length for gate-based outputs:
- ~0.05–1000ms with an exponential curve
- 1–100% of the step duration
- If `Mod2` mode is `GateLen`, CV2 scales this length

#### Copy / Paste
Copy the current step’s settings and paste them onto another step, even across hemispheres. Paste is only shown when the clipboard has data.

## Random
Selecting `Random` on the main page opens a scrollable, checklist-style randomizer for step parameters:

- `Offset`: randomize step Offsets
- `Amp`: randomize step Amplitudes
- `Shape`: randomize step Shapes
- `VOSC`: allow randomizing VOSC waveform numbers when Shape is `VOSC`
- `Triggers`: randomize step Triggers (occasionally)
- `Clocks`: randomize step Clocks (occasionally)
- `Length`: randomize step Lengths
- `Prob`: randomize step probabilities (50-100%)
- `RetrgLvl`: randomize step Retrigger Levels
- `ModMark`: randomize step Mod2 marks
- `GateLen`: randomize step Gate Lengths (1..50%)

Select `Apply` to apply randomization and return to the main view, or `Back` to exit without changes.

## TR2
When enabled, TR2 (input 2) **replaces TR1** as the step-advance trigger. TR1 still provides the clock timebase for step length. When disabled, TR1 advances steps and TR2 acts as Reset.

## Linking (paired hemispheres)
When both hemispheres run **EnvSeq**, you can link them to add two extra modulation inputs and two extra outputs.

- **Link is enabled from the right hemisphere.** On the right EnvSeq main screen, select `Link` to enter the linked view.
- The right hemisphere becomes a **linked control panel**: it no longer runs its own sequence.
- **Mod3 / Mod4**: the right hemisphere’s CV inputs become two additional modulation sources. Each has its own Mod mode (same list as Mod2).
- **Out3 / Out4**: the right hemisphere’s outputs become two additional Out modes (same list as Out2).
- The **left hemisphere** continues to run the sequence and computes the actual CV/gate values for Out3/Out4.
- Select **Unlink** on the right to return to normal operation.
